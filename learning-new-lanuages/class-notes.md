# W9D1 Learning a new Language/Framework on the Job
# Ft. Golang

I guarantee that there will be something in your new dev job that is strange an unfamiliar. Whether that's a language, framework or piece of technology that you've never worked with before, the point is that Lighthouse has set you up to be able to learn on your feet quickly. Here's some tips for approaching this in a new job. I've used Go as an example, partly because it's a pretty cool language, and partly because it's the language I had to learn on the job.

## Investigation
Before diving into a codebase, do a little bit of research into the language itself. This will give you some background into 

### Questions to ask
    - Why does this exist?
    - Why are we using it?

## Documentation

READ

THE

DOCS

Not all docs were created equal, but it's up to you to utlise them to the best of your ability. I can't tell you how many times I've been stuck on something and then read the docs and facepalmed because it was **RIGHT THERE** all along.

Here's the documentation we looked at today

[GoDocs](https://golang.org/)
[Gorilla](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/websocket) - A Go library for Websockets

## Fundamentals

Identify the familiar:
- How do I declare a variable in this language?
- Write an if statement?
- Write for loops
- Declare a function

## Pulling out key differences

Identify the unfamiliar:
- Is there a specific setup for this?
- What the heck is a pointer
- What are statically typed lanuages?

## Record the things you don't understand and make someone explain them to you

Try to keep a log of terms and technologies that make your brain want to explode and if you are able to snag some time each week with your senior dev, use that time to interrogate them and get you up to speed.

## Make something

One thing I like to do is walk through an online tutorial but with my own concept. This means I'm not just following along aimlessly (I never learn anything from copy-pasting tutorials)
